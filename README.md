# Description
A proof-of-concept Python implementation for the *ActionID* scheme from the ["Actions Speak Louder Than Passwords: A Dynamic Identity for Online Machine-to-Machine Communication" paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600160.3600165). The proof-of-concept consists of a Python library for the scheme named `actionid.py` and toy examples for the requestor (the `requestor` folder), the identity manager (the `idm` folder), and the server (the `server` folder).
