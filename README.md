# Description
A proof-of-concept Python implementation for the "Actions Speak Louder Than Passwords: A Dynamic Identity for Online Machine-to-Machine Communication" paper. The proof-of-concept consists of a Python package implementation for the scheme named `actionid.py`, and toy examples for the requestor (`requestor`), the identity manager (`idm`), and the server (`server`).
